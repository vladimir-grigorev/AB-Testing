# AB-Testing

## A very short introduction
This project consists of two files needed to set up a simple API service for performing the AB tests for an ecommerce product:
- Dockerfile with the requirements
- Python file with the Flask App exposing the APIs and further logic to perform the AB Tests

The tests are accelerated by using CUPED.
